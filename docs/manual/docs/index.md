        B[Web UI Dashboard] 
        C[CLI Tools]

    F --> M
```

### 🔄 Data Flow
1. **User Request** via Discord, Web UI, or API
2. **Orchestrator** validates and processes the request
3. **Container Engine** manages Docker containers
4. **Game Server** starts and becomes available
5. **Monitoring** tracks performance and health
6. **Backup System** protects game data
