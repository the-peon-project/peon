# The *PEON* project (FOSS)

Welcome to the PEON project.

The easy to use GSaaS (Game Server as a Service) platform.

*Whether self hosted or in the cloud, PEON aims to be efficient in resource consumption with modern tools for management of **ANY** self-hostable game server.*

Here you will find all of the official repositories for the PEON project's components.

## A story behind the name

We love all kinds of games (and want to support them all).

However, one of the many genres of game that we love to play is fantasy RTS.
We loved the strategy fantasy world of games like Warcraft 2, and thought the concept of the 'peon' worker fit our objectives fairly well.

The way we see it, a peon is the lowley lackey of any decent Orcish War Party, sent to do the work of tens of men.
They are often expected to raise War Camps with very little in the way of resources and even less time to do it in.
They must keep the War Camp stocked and running as battles commence at any time for any duration, and raise it to the ground when the War Chief demands it.

## Goals

That informs most of our project objectives:

1. **Easy** - We want non-coders to be able to deploy thier own servers and have thier friends join them (no tinkering required).
`The War Chief needs only to tell the peon what to do, the peon must figure it out and do it`
2. **Any Game** - If a game is self host-able, we want to support it.
`War Plans can be created very quickly for new War Camps, so that Chiefs can battle anywhere they see fit`
3. **Cheap** - Extremely efficient (designed to reduce hosting costs in the cloud, or to use as little resources as possible if running on your personal server).
`A peon should not require much gold/wood to build his Warcamp`
4. **Fast** - The servers must deploy/start/stop in as small a timeframe as possible. We want to game now, not later.
`Battles do not wait`
